## General

We (date.a.voice) use the Alexa Conversations API to run our skill. Your (the user) voice input is shared with Amazon where it is used to determine what the skill will do. There is a visual component to the skill, but it does not accept input.

## Data

We do not collect user data or share it with outside services.

Data about the date.a.voice game, such as the status of your date, is stored for the session and then discarded when the session ends.

We use S3 only to fetch images for the visual experience of date.a.voice.
